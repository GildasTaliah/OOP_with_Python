# OOP_with_Python

## Basic Python Class

This project offers an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It covers fundamental OOP concepts and provides practical examples to illustrate their implementation.

The highlight of the project is a Python class that developed and implemented the Black-Scholes Merton (BSM) model, including methods for computing European call options, put options, and delta. This class serves as a useful tool for BSM options pricing and options parameter sensitivity analysis.
